I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. . . . I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.

The game involves seven players on each side, with three Chasers who try to score goals with the Quaffle, one Keeper who guards the goalposts, and two Beaters who protect their side from the Bludgers and try to knock them toward the other team. The Seeker's job is to catch the Golden Snitch, which is worth 150 points and ends the game when caught.",

            ": Right,",
            "Wood: Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.",

            "Wood: This ball’s called the Quaffle, The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?",
            "Harry: The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score, So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?",
            "Wood: What’s basketball?",
            "Harry: Never mind,",
            "Wood: Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.",
            "Harry: Three Chasers, one Keeper, And they play with the Quaffle.",
            "Wood: I’ll show you now, Take this. I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do, These two are the Bludgers. Stand back, The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?",
            "Harry: Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goalposts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,",
            "Wood: Very good,",
            "Harry: Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?",
            "Wood: Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves. This, is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. Well, that’s it — any questions?"

Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you’re older. Yes, yes, I know what you’re thinking! ‘It’s all right for him, he’s an internationally famous wizard already! ’ But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, I’d say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven’t they? All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!

        "dialogue": [
            "Dumbledore: So, we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school. Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head, How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance. However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.",
            "Harry: Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him at the orphanage?",
            "Dumbledore: No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.",
            "Harry: But you didn’t really trust him, sir, did you? He told me .. . the Riddle who came out of that diary said, ‘Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did. ’",
            "Dumbledore: Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy, I had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues. As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime. I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts, Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike. Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death. All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name. Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .

            "Harry: What are you talking about?",
            "Ron: One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry Muggles. ’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight. ’ ‘Wand of elder, never prosper. ’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.",
            "Hermione: Harry and I were raised by Muggles, We were taught different superstitions. I think you’re right, It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose — the Cloak, the Cloak, the Cloak, the Cloak, the Cloak, the Cloak, the Cloak, the Cloak, the Cloak, the Cloak,",
            "Ron: the wand, the wand,",

            "Harry: We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,",
            "Hermione: And it’s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn’t noticed!",
            "Ron: Only if you shouted about it, Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, ‘I’ve got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough. ’ As long as you kept your trap shut —",
            "Hermione: Yes, but could you keep your trap shut? You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.",
            "Harry: There have?",
            "Hermione: The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but — oh, it’s all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people’s.",
            "Harry: But how do you know, that those wands — the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny — aren’t the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?",
            "Ron: What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death? So why would you take the stone?",
            "Harry: Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius . . . Mad-Eye . . . Dumbledore . . . my parents. . . . But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t want to come back, would they? I don’t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?",
            "Hermione: No, I don’t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that’s possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer’s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.",
            "Ron: What about the Cloak, though? Don’t you realize, he’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s. It’s infallible. We’ve never been spotted under it —",
            "Hermione: Of course not — we’re invisible when we’re under it, Ron!",
            "Ron: But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they’re not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It’s never occurred to me before, but I’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes in. Harry’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly new, is it, but it’s just . . . perfect!",
            "Hermione: Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone . . . Harry, what are you doing? I don’t think you should look around when he’s not here!"
