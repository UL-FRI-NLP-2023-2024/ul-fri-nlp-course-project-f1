# Natural language processing course 2023/24: `Conversations with Characters in Stories for Literacy`
## About
This is **Project 7** of the Natural Language Processing course in year 2023/2024 where we aim to tackle the problem of decreasing literacy skills of younger generations via quick and customized **Persona** bots from novels.
