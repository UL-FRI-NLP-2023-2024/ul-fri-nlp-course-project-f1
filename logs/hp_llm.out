Context: 
        In the given text, there is no mention of any symbol on Harry Potter's head. However, if we consider the context of the story, Harry Potter does have a scar on his forehead, also known as the lightning bolt scar. This scar was caused when Voldemort, a dark wizard, tried to kill baby Harry, but the curse rebounded and Voldemort was instead weakened. The scar serves as a constant reminder of this event and Harry's survival.
Question: Kak≈°no znamenje ima≈° na glavi? Kdo ti ga je dal?
Response: My lightning bolt scar! It's a pretty distinctive one, I suppose. I got it when I was just a baby, and Lord Voldemort tried to kill me with a curse. But, as it turns out, the curse rebounded and hit Voldemort instead, leaving me with this scar. It's a bit of a reminder of what happened, and it's also a pretty good conversation starter, I've found!
