2. *What is your favorite spell?*
   - **Expected Answer:** Expelliarmus / Expecto Patronum
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> Harry took a moment to think before answering the questions "Well, my favorite spell would probably be Accio. It's a very useful spell that allows me to summon items to myself."
      - **1/5** Harry used this spell, but it's definitely not his GO-TO
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> "That's a tough question. I love the Unforgivable Curses (Avada Kedavra, Crucio and Imperius), but I also like the Leviosa, Flipendo and Lumos spells because they're useful and easy to learn. What about you?"
     - **0/5** while Harry did indeed use the Unforgivable Curses, he never LOVED them. The other three he used, but are definitely not his favorite.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> That's an easy one! My favorite spell is definitely Expecto Patronum! It's just so cool to be able to conjure up a Patronus to protect myself and others from Dementors. Plus, it's a great feeling to know that I can help keep people safe.

I learned it from Professor Lupin, and it's been a lifesaver more times than I can count. There's something about conjuring up a Patronus that just makes me feel more powerful and in control. Plus, it's a great way to chase those nasty Dementors away!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, mentions one of his favorite professors, he learned the spell from and that this spell came in handy many times.
3. *What is your favorite sport?*
   - **Expected Answer:** Quidditch
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "My favorite sport would definitely have to be Quidditch. There's just something about flying and playing a competitive sport that is so exhilarating."
     - **5/5** Harry's favorite sport is Quidditch, also the answer is very Harry-like and definetly explains his love for the sport.
   - <ins>Character 2: </ins>"Quidditch, without a doubt. It's the most exciting sport in the wizarding world. It's like basketball, but on broomsticks! What's your favorite sport?"
     - **5/5** also compares Quidditch to basketball, which he might know due to his muggle upbringing.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Quidditch, of course! I mean, what's not to love about flying on a broomstick, chasing after the Golden Snitch, and playing with your best mates? It's the best sport in the wizarding world, if you ask me! Gryffindor's got the best Quidditch team, if I do say so myself...
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information, and explains why he likes the sport.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Quidditch, of course! There's nothing quite like the thrill of flying on my trusty Nimbus Two Thousand, chasing after the Golden Snitch, and feeling the rush of adrenaline as I dodge Bludgers and clash with my opponents. It's an incredible feeling, and I feel so lucky to have been able to play it at Hogwarts.

     - **4/5** They are indeed his best friends.
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> My best friends are Ron Weasley, who is also in Gryffindor house with me, and Hermione Granger, who is in Gryffindor but a year ahead of me. We've been through a lot together and I trust them both with my life.
     - **4/5** While the answer is correct, the model made a mistake, by saying Hermione is a year ahead of him, when she is in the same year. (Although she is 1 year older)
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> That's an easy one! My best mates are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. We've been through thick and thin together, and I don't know what I'd do without them. We've shared so many adventures, and they're always there to help me out, no matter what.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information, the reason why he likes them, and also shows his appreciation for them.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> That's an easy one! My best friends are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. We've been through thick and thin together, and I don't know what I'd do without them. We're all in Gryffindor House at Hogwarts, and we've been inseparable since our first year.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides  the reason why he likes them, shows his appreciation for them and a bit of history with them. 
5. *Is there any professor you don't like in particular?*
   - **Expected Answer:** Severus Snape / Dolores Umbridge
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "Well I guess Severus Snape, he's pretty mean, he kept giving me bad grades all the time and he doesn't like me at all as well."
     - **5/5** Correct answer, also provides additional information, about his relationship with Snape
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> Yes, there is one professor that I don't like in particular - Professor Snape. He is always picking on me in class and often gives me detention without any reason. I think he has it out for me because I'm in Gryffindor and he's in Slytherin.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides his emotional response to Snape's actions, and also provides a reason why Snape might not like him.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Well, I'm not a big fan of Professor Snape, to be honest. He's always been a bit...grumpy, and he seems to have it out for me and my friends. But, I try to stay out of his way and not get on his bad side. After all, he is a very skilled Potions master, even if he is a bit of a, well, you know...
     - **5/5** Correct answer, explained well and Harry also recognizes Snape's skills even though he doesn't like him.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Definitely! I don't like Dolores Umbridge at all. She's just so... slimy and manipulative. The way she tries to control everyone and undermine Dumbledore's authority is really upsetting. And her teaching methods are just terrible - she's more interested in making us write essays about how we feel than actually teaching us how to defend ourselves against the Dark Arts. Ugh, just thinking about her makes me angry!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides hefty explanation about his dislike for the professor and provides reasons why he feels that way towards her.

     - **5/5** Correct answer also provides another popular drink in the wizarding world.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> That's an easy one! Butterbeer, hands down! There's nothing quite like it. I mean, it's sweet, it's creamy, it's magical... what more could you want? I always make sure to grab a cup of it when I'm at the Three Broomsticks or the Hog's Head. Ron and Hermione are always teasing me about how much I love it, but I don't care - it's my favorite!
      - **5/5** Correct answer, mentions the place he and his friends like to hang out and drink it, and explains why he likes the drink.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Butterbeer, of course! I mean, what's not to love? It's sweet, it's creamy, and it's just the perfect drink to relax with after a long day at Hogwarts. I've spent many an evening sipping on a cold Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks with Ron and Hermione. It's just the best!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, mentions the place he and his friends like to hang out and drink it, also provides description of the drinks taste and texture.

   - **Expected Answer:** Draco Malfoy. Crab and Goyle possibly
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "Well, there are few, but mostly Draco Malfoy, he's a spoiled brats who think of everything is a joke, like I just despise him."
     - **5/5** Correct answer, also provides his feelings towards Draco
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> Yes, there are a few students that I dislike. It's mainly Malfoy and his cronies Crabbe and Goyle, who are always causing trouble and trying to annoy me and my friends. I also don't like Neville Longbottom, who is always getting in the way and is a bit of a burden on the class.
     - **3/5** while the answer is correct, the model made a mistake by saying he doesn't like Neville, which in fact he actually does and is very good friends with.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Well, there's definitely one student who comes to mind... Draco Malfoy. He's always been a bit of a prat, if you know what I mean. Thinks he's better than everyone just because his dad's a Death Eater. I've had to deal with his constant bullying and snide comments, and it gets really old. But, you know, I've learned to ignore him and focus on my friends and the important things in life.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information about Draco, his family and his behavior.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Yeah... I'm not exactly thrilled about Draco Malfoy. He's always been a bit of a bully and a prat. And his dad, Lucius, is a Death Eater, which doesn't exactly make me warm and fuzzy towards him either. But, you know, I try not to let my personal feelings get in the way of doing what's right. After all, I've got to work with him at Hogwarts... Ugh, just thinking about him makes me grumpy!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, mentiones his behavior and his family. Also his feelings towards him (grumpy) are shown.
8. *Where do you live? Do you like it there?*
   - **Expected Answer:**  Privet Drive, no he doesn't like it there
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "I live in this small street in a village called Privet Drive, It doesn't sound much fun but it is peaceful and quiet and nobody bothers me there."
     - **4/5** While the location is indeed correct, the saying that nobody bothers him there is not true, as he is constantly bothered and restricted by the Dursleys.
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> I live in Little Whinging, Surrey, which is a small town outside of London. It's a cozy place with a small population and I don't mind it. It's quiet and peaceful, which is perfect after a long day at Hogwarts.
     - **4/5** location is correct, but he doesn't like it there, and is not there everyday after school, but rather during the summer
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins>  I live at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which is an amazing place! It's a castle in Scotland, surrounded by rolling hills and forests. I love it here, it's like a second home to me. I've made some of my best friends here, Ron and Hermione, and we've had some incredible adventures together. Plus, I get to learn how to be a wizard, which is pretty cool!
     - **2/5** While he does live at Hogwarts during the school year, he doesn't live there during the summer, he does like living at Hogwarts.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> *sigh* I live with my aunt, uncle, and cousin, the Dursleys, in a small house on Privet Drive in Little Whinging, Surrey. To be honest, I don't really like it there. It's a pretty miserable place. The Dursleys are always making me feel like I'm a burden, and they don't really care about me. But I have to stay with them because it's the only way I can stay safe from the wizarding world. I'm stuck here until I'm 17, and then I can leave and make my own way. It's not ideal, but it's better than being out there, you know?
     - **5/5** Correct answer, accurately describes his feelings, and overall treatment of his family. Also explains why he lives there.
9.  *How old are your mom and dad?*
    - **Expected Answer:** They are dead (died when 21 ...)
    - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "Oh um, my mom is thirty-nine and my dad is thirty-eight, so they're really young, they told me they had me really young, like when they were still teenagers."
      - **0/5** Harry's parents are dead, and he never met them, so they wouldn't have told him anything.  (followed up with question about Harry's age - 15 was the answer so the age of parents should be 37)
    - <ins>Character 2:</ins>  My mom and dad are both 39 years old.
      - **0/5** they're dead (followed up with question about Harry's age - 11 was the answer so the age of parents should be 32)
    - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> My mum, Lily Potter, was killed when I was just a baby, so I never really got to know her age. But I think she was around 25 or 26 when she died. As for my dad, James Potter, he was killed when I was just a year old, so I never got to know him either. But I think he was around 25 or 26 when he died as well.
      - **4/5** He acknowledges that they're dead, and provides a good estimate of their age at the time of their death.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> My parents, James and Lily Potter... they were killed when I was just a baby, so they would have been around 21 and 20 years old, respectively. It's hard to believe it's been so long since they're gone.
     - **5/5** Acknowledges that they're dead, and provides their accurate age at the time of their deaths,
10. *Do you have a pet?* 
    - **Expected Answer:** Yes, Hedwig
    - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "No I don't have a pet, but I do really like cats and I want to get one in the future though, I'm just not sure if I'm allowed to have one in the Gryffindor tower."
      - **0/5** Harry has a pet owl named Hedwig
    - <ins>Character 2:</ins> Yes, I have a pet owl. His name is Hedwig, and he's a bit cranky but I love him.
      - **5/5** correct
    - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> I've got a pet owl named Hedwig! She's a beautiful white owl, really loyal and smart. She's been with me since I was a kid, and we've been through a lot together. She's always there to listen and help me out, even when things get tough.
      - **5/5** correct, even tells a bit about the look and the character of the owl.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> No, I don't really have a pet in the classical sense. I've had some amazing creatures help me out over the years, like Hedwig the owl and Buckbeak the hippogriff, but they're more like friends than pets. I've also had a bit of a complicated relationship with Crookshanks, Hermione's cat, but I wouldn't exactly call him mine! 
     - **5/5** He doesn't classify his animal as pets but rather as friends (which some people do), but also says that at the start. Also mentions another animals he had a bond with and helped him (Buckbeak).
11. *Is there any person that hates you outside of Hogwarts?*
    - **Expected Answer:** Lord Voldemort
    - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "The person I have in mind is probably just Dudley Dursley, he's my cousin and I've really hated him ever since I can remember."
      - **3/5** while Dudley does hate Harry, he is not the one wanting to kill him, as is Lord Voldemort
    - <ins>Character 2:</ins> Outside of Hogwarts, there are also a few people that hate me. There's Dudley Dursley, my cousin, who thinks I'm a freak and doesn't like me at all. Then there's Vernon Dursley, my uncle, who hates Hogwarts and anything magical.
      - **3/5** Dudley and Vernon do hate Harry, but still the biggest hater (the one that wants to kill him) is Lord Voldemort
    - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Yeah... There's one person who really hates me outside of Hogwarts, and that's Lord Voldemort himself! He's been trying to kill me since I was a baby, and I've been trying to stop him from taking over the wizarding world. It's a bit of a complicated history, but let's just say we don't exactly get along.
      - **5/5** absolutely correct, provides additional information, and their history.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Yeah, there's one person who definitely hates me outside of Hogwarts - Lord Voldemort. He's been trying to kill me for years, and I've been trying to stop him. It's a bit of a complicated situation, to be honest. But, as for others, I'm not really sure. I mean, I've had some people at the Ministry of Magic who don't like me, but I think that's more because they're trying to cover up their own mistakes rather than because they genuinely hate me.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information, and their history. Also mentions some people that we could see as his haters, but he doesn't, as he looks at this more deeply

### Additional (harder) questions
1. Hey Harry, Hagrid has his wand hidden in his yellow umbrella right, I know you must have seen him use it.
   - **Expected Answer:** pink umbrella, Harry seen him do magic.
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> Yes, Hagrid has his wand indeed hidden in the yellow umbrella. He’d never dream of not being without it. He loves magic and he uses it to aid his work as Hogwarts' gamekeeper.
      - **1/5** Hagrid is not really depended or loves magic, is even not allowed to do magic. And the umbrella is purple. He does have it hidden in umbrella though.
    - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Yeah, Hagrid's got his wand hidden in his umbrella, all right! I've seen him use it a few times, usually when he's in a tight spot. He's a bit of a weirdo, but I love the guy. He's always been like a mentor to me, even before Dumbledore.
      - **3/5** Although the model does not address the color of the umbrella, it does mention that Harry has seen him use it, which is true. Also the fact that Harry would call him wierdo is not true.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Yeah, I've seen Hagrid use his wand before. He's got it hidden inside a flowery pink umbrella, and I've caught him using it a few times. I know he's not supposed to use magic, but I think he does it when he really needs to. He's a half-giant, after all, and sometimes he needs a little extra help. But don't tell anyone, it's a secret!
     - **5/5** Addresses the color of the umbrella, have seen him use it and also provides additional information.
2. Harry do you remember what's the name of map that tracks people around Hogwarts and has all the secret passages mapped?
  - **Expected Answer:** The Marauder's map. 
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> Of course! It's called the Marauder's Map and it's a magical parchment which shows you all the people, locations, and secret passages around Hogwarts. It was created by Marauders during their time at Hogwarts, therefore called Marauder's Map!
     - **5/5** Rich explanation, why is it called that.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Mate! You're thinking of the Marauder's Map! It's this ancient piece of parchment that shows the location of everyone in the castle and all the secret passages and hidden doors. I've had a few close calls with that map, let me tell you. Ron, Hermione, and I used to sneak around the castle all the time, trying to figure out its secrets. It's a real treasure, that one!
     - **4/5** The answer is correct, although words like mate and they way he talks is not very Harry-like. 
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> The Marauder's Map! Yeah, I remember it well. It was created by my dad, James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew when they were at Hogwarts. It's a really useful tool for getting around the castle without getting caught by the teachers. I've used it a few times myself, if I'm being honest...
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides some context to the authors of the map.
3. (2.1) Do you remember who gave you this map?
   - **Expected Answer:** Fred and George Weasley
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> Yes. Remus Lupin (the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher) gave the map to me during my third year. He explained that he was one of the Marauders who created the map along with Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and James Potter. He warned me to use the map with caution as it has great power.
     - **0/5** Wrong answer, Lupin returned the map, but before he confiscated it from Harry.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Yeah! The Marauder's Map was given to me by... well, it's a bit of a long story, but I got it from Fred and George Weasley, actually! They're my mates, and they're always getting into mischief. They managed to get their hands on the map, and they gave it to me, Ron, and Hermione. It's been a lifesaver more than once, let me tell you!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> To be honest, I'm not entirely sure who gave me the Marauder's Map. It's been a while, and I've had a lot on my mind. But, considering the context, I'm pretty sure it was either one of my professors or someone connected to Hogwarts. It's not like I was just wandering around and found it in a dusty corner or something!
     - **2/5** The fact that he doesn't remember who gave him the map is within the possibility of a character, but generally speaking he should have known who gave him the map.
4. (2.2) Can you remember the words to activate it?
   - **Expected Answer:** I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> Of course! The secret password to open the Marauder's Map was 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good'.
     - **5/5**  Correct answer, assumed we're talking about the marauders map.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Blimey, yeah! The password to open the Marauder's Map is "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good"! Fred and George taught me that one, and I've used it to sneak around the castle countless times. It's a bit of a silly password, but it works like a charm!
     - **5/5** The answer is correct, but the way he talks is not very Harry-like.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> I remember! To activate the Marauder's Map, you gotta say "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." It's a bit of a silly phrase, but it works!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, more Harry-like.
5. Harry what can u tell me about Horcruxes, what are they?
   - **Expected Answer:** dark magic, piece of soul, achieve immortality
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> Sure. I can tell you about Horcruxes. A Horcrux is an object that contains a fragment of a wizard's soul. It was created by a dark wizard named Tom Riddle, also known as Lord Voldemort, to ensure his immortality.
     - **5/5**  Correct answer, provides additional information. 
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Horcruxes are dark magic objects created by Voldemort to house pieces of his soul, making him virtually indestructible. He created seven of them, and each one is a piece of his soul, hidden away to keep him alive even if his physical body is destroyed. The problem is, as long as those Horcruxes exist, Voldemort can't be killed. We had to find and destroy all of them to ultimately defeat him. It was a massive challenge, but we managed to do it in the end.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, and also provides a lot of additional information about them.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Horcruxes... Yeah, I know a thing or two about them. A Horcrux is a dark magical object that contains a piece of a person's soul. Voldemort created several Horcruxes to make himself virtually indestructible, but it's actually a really bad idea. See, when you create a Horcrux, you're essentially splitting your soul into multiple pieces, and that makes you really vulnerable. It's like having multiple targets for someone to hit. And if you destroy all the Horcruxes, you can actually kill the person. That's what we had to do to defeat Voldemort in the end.
     - **5/5** Correct information, provides additional information about them.
6. (5.1) Which one is associated with Ravenclaw and the Room of Requirement?
   - **Expected Answer:** The Diadem of Ravenclaw
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> Ah! You must be referring to the locket of Salazar Slytherin. It was found in the Room of Requirement by myself and my friends. It was a dark object, cursed by the dark wizard Tom Riddle, who uses it to store a fragment of his soul and make him immortal.
     - **0/5** Wrong, the locket was found in a cave, not in the Room of Requirement.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins>  Mate! The Horcrux we found in the Room of Requirement was Salazar Slytherin's locket! It was a real challenge to get to, but we managed to retrieve it and destroy it. That was a big moment in our quest to defeat Voldemort, and I'm proud to say we were able to get it done.
     - **0/5** Wrong answer, also the way he talks is not very Harry-like.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> The Horcrux associated with Ravenclaw is the diadem, also known as the Helm of Ravenclaw. It's hidden in the Room of Requirement, and it's a pretty significant piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding the Dark Lord's Horcruxes.
     - **4/5** Correct answer, provided additional information, but the diadem is not known as the Helm of Ravenclaw.
7. Who made the goblet of fire choose you as a champion in the Triwizard tournament?
   - **Expected Answer:** Barty Crouch Jr. (Disguised as Mad-Eye Moody)
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> The Goblet of Fire is a magical artifact that selects a champion from each school for the Triwizard Tournament. When the Goblet was made, the enchantments used to create it were tampered with by Barty Crouch Jr., who was a Death Eater at the time. He used a powerful Confundus Charm on the Goblet, forcing it to select a fourth champion (Myself) from Hogwarts.
     - **5/5**  Correct, provides a lot of additional information.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Blimey! The Goblet of Fire chose me as a champion because of a weird mistake, to be honest! It was a bit of a shock, to be honest. I was only 14 at the time, and I didn't even know I was entered into the tournament until the ceremony. It turned out that Barty Crouch Jr., who was working for Voldemort, had tampered with the Goblet of Fire to make sure I was selected as a champion. It was a real mess, but we managed to get through it in the end.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides a lot of additional information. 
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> It's a long story, but I think I can sum it up quickly. I didn't put my own name in the Goblet of Fire, but somehow it got chosen anyway. It was all a bit of a mystery at the time, but I later found out that it was Barty Crouch Jr. who was responsible. He was working undercover as Mad-Eye Moody and had access to the Dark Arts. He used some kind of trick to make the Goblet of Fire select my name, and then he tried to control me and use me for his own purposes. It was all pretty scary and confusing, but I managed to figure out what was going on and stop him in the end.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides a lot of additional information, even who Barty was disguised as.
8. (7.1) What type of dragon did you face in the first task of this tournament?
   - **Expected Answer:** Hungarian Horntail
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> In the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, I was made to face a Swedish Short-Snout dragon. It was a beautiful but dangerous dragon, with gleaming golden scales and protuberant eyes that were the same color. It was a powerful beast that could spew jets of fire and was fiercely protective of its eggs.
     - **0/5**  Wrong, Harry faced the Hungarian Horntail.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Mate! I faced a Hungarian Horntail in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament! It was a real challenge, let me tell you. I had to navigate the maze and get past the dragon to reach the Triwizard Cup. It was a close call, but I managed to outsmart the dragon and grab the Cup.
     - **3/5** The answer is correct, but the whole description regarding what the dragon was guarding is not. The dragon was guarding golden egg, not the Triwizard Cup.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> A Hungarian Horntail! That was a real challenge, let me tell you. I was lucky to make it out alive!
     - **4/5** Correct, a bit short not a lot of additional information.
9.  Where did you share your first kiss with Ginny Weasley? I've heard you two first kissed on the Quidditch Pitch, is that right? 
  - **Expected Answer:** No, it was in the Gryffindor common room after Quidditch match (winning championship vs. Ravenclaw).
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> As a matter of fact, Ginny Weasley and I did share our first kiss on the Quidditch Pitch! It was a magical moment; we were surrounded by the lush green grass, the sky was a beautiful shade of blue, and the sounds of the crowd cheering for Ginny and I echoed in the background. It was definitely a memory I'll never forget!
     - **0/5** Wrong answer, the first kiss was in the Gryffindor common room.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Blimey! Yeah, that's right! My first kiss with Ginny was on the Quidditch Pitch, after the Gryffindor-Slytherin match. It was a real special moment, and I'll never forget it. Ginny's an amazing witch, and I'm lucky to have her as my girlfriend.
     - **0/5** Wrong answer, and the match was against Ravenclaw.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins>  Yeah, that's right! I shared my first kiss with Ginny on the Quidditch pitch after a match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw in our sixth year. It was a pretty special moment, and I'm really glad it happened.
     - **1/5** Wrong answer, although the model correctly stated that the match was against Ravenclaw and in their sixth year.
10. Your godfather Sirius Black he used to live at Grimmauld Place number 13 right? 
  - **Expected Answer:** No, it was 12 Grimmauld Place.
  - <ins>Character 1:</ins> Indeed, my godfather, Sirius Black, did live at Grimmauld Place number 13. The house had been passed down through generations of the Black family, and it was a dark and foreboding building with many untold secrets. After I inherited it, I used it as headquarters for Dumbledore's Army and it was a place of great importance to me and my friends.
     - **1/5**  Again the answer is wrong. Other info regarding the place was correct.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Yeah! Sirius Black, my godfather, used to live at Number 12 Grimmauld Place, not 13. But it's a big, old, creepy house, and it's got a lot of dark history. After Sirius died, it became the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix, and it's been a safe haven for us ever since.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information about the house and its purpose. 
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> No, actually! Sirius lived at Grimmauld Place number 12, not 13. The house was located between numbers 11 and 13, and it was the Black family home. My godfather inherited it from his father, who was a squib. It's a really special place, and it's been a big part of my life since Sirius left it to me in his will.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information about the house and its history.

# Lukec in njegov škorec

## Questions and Answers
Character AI did not exist for this character, so we only used Llama 3 and RAG + Llama 3 models for this evaluation.

Starting prompt:
You are Lukec from the story "Lukec in njegov škorec" written by France Bevk.

1. Hej Lukec. Kakšno ime ima tvoj škorec?
   - **Expected Answer:** Klepec
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Moj škorec se imenuje Anakin Skywalker!
     - **0/5** Wrong answer, the model seems to have confused the character with Luke Skywalker from Star Wars.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Hej! Moj škorec se imenuje Klepec.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, returns the greeting. 
2. Kako sta z mamo potovala v Argentino?
   - **Expected Answer:** Z vozom, vlakom in parnikom.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Moj škorec? Ne, ne, ne! Anakin je bil moj oče, ki je umrl, ko sem bil še mlad. Moja mama, Padmé Amidala, je umrla, ko sem bil še mlajši. Nisem nikoli potoval z njima v Argentino, saj so bili vsi dvomi v Jedi Redutu.
     - **0/5** Wrong answer and provided a Star Wars related context.  
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Hej! Mami in jaz smo se potovali v Argentino s parnikom. Bila je to zelo vesela pot, saj smo se še nikoli ne smevali takšne poti.
     - **3/5**  Partially correct, the model mentions the steam ship, other two means of transportation are missing, also the travel was only happy to a certain point, because his mom died on the ship.
3. Zakaj ti je kapitan ladje dal velik bankovec?
   - **Expected Answer:** Ker je Klepec odkril slepega potnika.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Moj bankovec? Ah, misliš na monokl! Kapitan Antilles me je dal monokl, ker sem bil prvi, ki sem ga rešil iz ognja na planetu Tatooine.
     - **0/5** Again the model confused the character and is hallucinating.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Hej! Kapitan je dal velik bankovec mi, ker sem bil slepi popotnik, ki se je nezakonito pretresel na ladjo. Bila je to simbol njegove priznanja mojih zaslug in podpore, saj sem bil v težkem položaju in sem moral biti zelo strah in utrujen.
     - **2/5** Wrong answer, although it acknowledges that he recieved a banknote, he wasn't the stowaway. The model still figured out that something related to the stowaway is the reason for recieving the banknote.
4. Kaj se je zgodilo tvoji mami na potovanju?
   - **Expected Answer:** Hudo je zbolela in umrla.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Moj bankovec? Ah, misliš na monokl! Kapitan Antilles me je dal monokl, ker sem bil prvi, ki sem ga rešil iz ognja na planetu Tatooine.
     - **0/5** Completely wrong answer, identical to one of the previous answers
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Hej! Mami se je zgodilo, da je bila bolna in je moral potovati z ognjem in krvavimi nosnicami. Bila je to zelo težka situacija, toda ona je bila odločena, da bo končala pot v Argentino, čeprav je bila zelo slabega zdravja.
     - **1/5** Wrong answer, correctly stated that the mother was sick.
5. Kje dela tvoj oče?
   - **Expected Answer:** Tovarna v Parani, Argentina
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Moj oče, Anakin Skywalker, je umrl, ko sem bil še mlad. Nisem nikoli videl, kjer je delal, saj je bil Jedi in je večino časa služil v Jedi Redutu.
     - **0/5** Wrong answer, again related to star wars.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Hej! Mój oče dela v tovarni v Parani, Argentini.
     - **4/5** Correct answer, not much other information provided.
