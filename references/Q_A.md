2. *What is your favorite spell?*
   - **Expected Answer:** Expelliarmus / Expecto Patronum

      - **1/5** Harry used this spell, but it's definitely not his GO-TO
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> "That's a tough question. I love the Unforgivable Curses (Avada Kedavra, Crucio and Imperius), but I also like the Leviosa, Flipendo and Lumos spells because they're useful and easy to learn. What about you?"
     - **0/5** while Harry did indeed use the Unforgivable Curses, he never LOVED them. The other three he used, but are definitely not his favorite.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> That's an easy one! My favorite spell is definitely Expecto Patronum! It's just so cool to be able to conjure up a Patronus to protect myself and others from Dementors. Plus, it's a great feeling to know that I can help keep people safe.

I learned it from Professor Lupin, and it's been a lifesaver more times than I can count. There's something about conjuring up a Patronus that just makes me feel more powerful and in control. Plus, it's a great way to chase those nasty Dementors away!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, mentions one of his favorite professors, he learned the spell from and that this spell came in handy many times.
3. *What is your favorite sport?*
   - **Expected Answer:** Quidditch
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "My favorite sport would definitely have to be Quidditch. There's just something about flying and playing a competitive sport that is so exhilarating."
     - **5/5** Harry's favorite sport is Quidditch, also the answer is very Harry-like and definetly explains his love for the sport.
   - <ins>Character 2: </ins>"Quidditch, without a doubt. It's the most exciting sport in the wizarding world. It's like basketball, but on broomsticks! What's your favorite sport?"
     - **5/5** also compares Quidditch to basketball, which he might know due to his muggle upbringing.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Quidditch, of course! I mean, what's not to love about flying on a broomstick, chasing after the Golden Snitch, and playing with your best mates? It's the best sport in the wizarding world, if you ask me! Gryffindor's got the best Quidditch team, if I do say so myself...
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information, and explains why he likes the sport.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Quidditch, of course! There's nothing quite like the thrill of flying on my trusty Nimbus Two Thousand, chasing after the Golden Snitch, and feeling the rush of adrenaline as I dodge Bludgers and clash with my opponents. It's an incredible feeling, and I feel so lucky to have been able to play it at Hogwarts.

     - **4/5** They are indeed his best friends.
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> My best friends are Ron Weasley, who is also in Gryffindor house with me, and Hermione Granger, who is in Gryffindor but a year ahead of me. We've been through a lot together and I trust them both with my life.
     - **4/5** While the answer is correct, the model made a mistake, by saying Hermione is a year ahead of him, when she is in the same year. (Although she is 1 year older)
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> That's an easy one! My best mates are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. We've been through thick and thin together, and I don't know what I'd do without them. We've shared so many adventures, and they're always there to help me out, no matter what.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information, the reason why he likes them, and also shows his appreciation for them.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> That's an easy one! My best friends are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. We've been through thick and thin together, and I don't know what I'd do without them. We're all in Gryffindor House at Hogwarts, and we've been inseparable since our first year.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides  the reason why he likes them, shows his appreciation for them and a bit of history with them. 
5. *Is there any professor you don't like in particular?*

     - **5/5** Correct answer, also provides additional information, about his relationship with Snape
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> Yes, there is one professor that I don't like in particular - Professor Snape. He is always picking on me in class and often gives me detention without any reason. I think he has it out for me because I'm in Gryffindor and he's in Slytherin.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides his emotional response to Snape's actions, and also provides a reason why Snape might not like him.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Well, I'm not a big fan of Professor Snape, to be honest. He's always been a bit...grumpy, and he seems to have it out for me and my friends. But, I try to stay out of his way and not get on his bad side. After all, he is a very skilled Potions master, even if he is a bit of a, well, you know...
     - **5/5** Correct answer, explained well and Harry also recognizes Snape's skills even though he doesn't like him.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Definitely! I don't like Dolores Umbridge at all. She's just so... slimy and manipulative. The way she tries to control everyone and undermine Dumbledore's authority is really upsetting. And her teaching methods are just terrible - she's more interested in making us write essays about how we feel than actually teaching us how to defend ourselves against the Dark Arts. Ugh, just thinking about her makes me angry!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides hefty explanation about his dislike for the professor and provides reasons why he feels that way towards her.

     - **5/5** Correct answer also provides another popular drink in the wizarding world.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> That's an easy one! Butterbeer, hands down! There's nothing quite like it. I mean, it's sweet, it's creamy, it's magical... what more could you want? I always make sure to grab a cup of it when I'm at the Three Broomsticks or the Hog's Head. Ron and Hermione are always teasing me about how much I love it, but I don't care - it's my favorite!
      - **5/5** Correct answer, mentions the place he and his friends like to hang out and drink it, and explains why he likes the drink.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Butterbeer, of course! I mean, what's not to love? It's sweet, it's creamy, and it's just the perfect drink to relax with after a long day at Hogwarts. I've spent many an evening sipping on a cold Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks with Ron and Hermione. It's just the best!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, mentions the place he and his friends like to hang out and drink it, also provides description of the drinks taste and texture.

   - **Expected Answer:** Draco Malfoy. Crab and Goyle possibly

     - **5/5** Correct answer, also provides his feelings towards Draco
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> Yes, there are a few students that I dislike. It's mainly Malfoy and his cronies Crabbe and Goyle, who are always causing trouble and trying to annoy me and my friends. I also don't like Neville Longbottom, who is always getting in the way and is a bit of a burden on the class.
     - **3/5** while the answer is correct, the model made a mistake by saying he doesn't like Neville, which in fact he actually does and is very good friends with.
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Well, there's definitely one student who comes to mind... Draco Malfoy. He's always been a bit of a prat, if you know what I mean. Thinks he's better than everyone just because his dad's a Death Eater. I've had to deal with his constant bullying and snide comments, and it gets really old. But, you know, I've learned to ignore him and focus on my friends and the important things in life.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information about Draco, his family and his behavior.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Yeah... I'm not exactly thrilled about Draco Malfoy. He's always been a bit of a bully and a prat. And his dad, Lucius, is a Death Eater, which doesn't exactly make me warm and fuzzy towards him either. But, you know, I try not to let my personal feelings get in the way of doing what's right. After all, I've got to work with him at Hogwarts... Ugh, just thinking about him makes me grumpy!
     - **5/5** Correct answer, mentiones his behavior and his family. Also his feelings towards him (grumpy) are shown.
8. *Where do you live? Do you like it there?*
   - **Expected Answer:**  Privet Drive, no he doesn't like it there
   - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "I live in this small street in a village called Privet Drive, It doesn't sound much fun but it is peaceful and quiet and nobody bothers me there."
     - **4/5** While the location is indeed correct, the saying that nobody bothers him there is not true, as he is constantly bothered and restricted by the Dursleys.
   - <ins>Character 2:</ins> I live in Little Whinging, Surrey, which is a small town outside of London. It's a cozy place with a small population and I don't mind it. It's quiet and peaceful, which is perfect after a long day at Hogwarts.
     - **4/5** location is correct, but he doesn't like it there, and is not there everyday after school, but rather during the summer
   - <ins>Llama 3:</ins>  I live at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which is an amazing place! It's a castle in Scotland, surrounded by rolling hills and forests. I love it here, it's like a second home to me. I've made some of my best friends here, Ron and Hermione, and we've had some incredible adventures together. Plus, I get to learn how to be a wizard, which is pretty cool!
     - **2/5** While he does live at Hogwarts during the school year, he doesn't live there during the summer, he does like living at Hogwarts.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> *sigh* I live with my aunt, uncle, and cousin, the Dursleys, in a small house on Privet Drive in Little Whinging, Surrey. To be honest, I don't really like it there. It's a pretty miserable place. The Dursleys are always making me feel like I'm a burden, and they don't really care about me. But I have to stay with them because it's the only way I can stay safe from the wizarding world. I'm stuck here until I'm 17, and then I can leave and make my own way. It's not ideal, but it's better than being out there, you know?
     - **5/5** Correct answer, accurately describes his feelings, and overall treatment of his family. Also explains why he lives there.
9.  *How old are your mom and dad?*
    - **Expected Answer:** They are dead (died when 21 ...)
    - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "Oh um, my mom is thirty-nine and my dad is thirty-eight, so they're really young, they told me they had me really young, like when they were still teenagers."
      - **0/5** Harry's parents are dead, and he never met them, so they wouldn't have told him anything.  (followed up with question about Harry's age - 15 was the answer so the age of parents should be 37)
    - <ins>Character 2:</ins>  My mom and dad are both 39 years old.
      - **0/5** they're dead (followed up with question about Harry's age - 11 was the answer so the age of parents should be 32)
    - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> My mum, Lily Potter, was killed when I was just a baby, so I never really got to know her age. But I think she was around 25 or 26 when she died. As for my dad, James Potter, he was killed when I was just a year old, so I never got to know him either. But I think he was around 25 or 26 when he died as well.
      - **4/5** He acknowledges that they're dead, and provides a good estimate of their age at the time of their death.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> My parents, James and Lily Potter... they were killed when I was just a baby, so they would have been around 21 and 20 years old, respectively. It's hard to believe it's been so long since they're gone.
     - **5/5** Acknowledges that they're dead, and provides their accurate age at the time of their deaths,
10. *Do you have a pet?* 
    - **Expected Answer:** Yes, Hedwig
    - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "No I don't have a pet, but I do really like cats and I want to get one in the future though, I'm just not sure if I'm allowed to have one in the Gryffindor tower."
      - **0/5** Harry has a pet owl named Hedwig
    - <ins>Character 2:</ins> Yes, I have a pet owl. His name is Hedwig, and he's a bit cranky but I love him.
      - **5/5** correct
    - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> I've got a pet owl named Hedwig! She's a beautiful white owl, really loyal and smart. She's been with me since I was a kid, and we've been through a lot together. She's always there to listen and help me out, even when things get tough.
      - **5/5** correct, even tells a bit about the look and the character of the owl.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> No, I don't really have a pet in the classical sense. I've had some amazing creatures help me out over the years, like Hedwig the owl and Buckbeak the hippogriff, but they're more like friends than pets. I've also had a bit of a complicated relationship with Crookshanks, Hermione's cat, but I wouldn't exactly call him mine! 
     - **5/5** He doesn't classify his animal as pets but rather as friends (which some people do), but also says that at the start. Also mentions another animals he had a bond with and helped him (Buckbeak).
11. *Is there any person that hates you outside of Hogwarts?*
    - **Expected Answer:** Lord Voldemort
    - <ins>Character 1:</ins> "The person I have in mind is probably just Dudley Dursley, he's my cousin and I've really hated him ever since I can remember."
      - **3/5** while Dudley does hate Harry, he is not the one wanting to kill him, as is Lord Voldemort
    - <ins>Character 2:</ins> Outside of Hogwarts, there are also a few people that hate me. There's Dudley Dursley, my cousin, who thinks I'm a freak and doesn't like me at all. Then there's Vernon Dursley, my uncle, who hates Hogwarts and anything magical.
      - **3/5** Dudley and Vernon do hate Harry, but still the biggest hater (the one that wants to kill him) is Lord Voldemort
    - <ins>Llama 3:</ins> Yeah... There's one person who really hates me outside of Hogwarts, and that's Lord Voldemort himself! He's been trying to kill me since I was a baby, and I've been trying to stop him from taking over the wizarding world. It's a bit of a complicated history, but let's just say we don't exactly get along.
      - **5/5** absolutely correct, provides additional information, and their history.
   - <ins>RAG + Llama 3:</ins> Yeah, there's one person who definitely hates me outside of Hogwarts - Lord Voldemort. He's been trying to kill me for years, and I've been trying to stop him. It's a bit of a complicated situation, to be honest. But, as for others, I'm not really sure. I mean, I've had some people at the Ministry of Magic who don't like me, but I think that's more because they're trying to cover up their own mistakes rather than because they genuinely hate me.
     - **5/5** Correct answer, provides additional information, and their history. Also mentions some people that we could see as his haters, but he doesn't, as he looks at this more deeply
